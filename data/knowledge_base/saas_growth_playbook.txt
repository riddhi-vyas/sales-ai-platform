SAAS GROWTH COMPANY PLAYBOOK

TARGET PERSONA: CTO, VP Engineering, Head of Product
DEAL SIZE: $25K - $200K ARR  
SALES CYCLE: 2-6 months

KEY PAIN POINTS:
- Scaling bottlenecks as user base grows
- Engineering team spending too much time on operations
- Lack of visibility into system performance
- Customer churn due to reliability issues
- Pressure to ship features faster

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
1. What's your current monthly active user count?
2. How much engineering time goes to operations vs features?
3. What's your biggest scaling challenge right now?
4. How do you currently monitor system health?
5. What's your target growth rate for next 12 months?

QUALIFYING CRITERIA:
- 10K+ active users OR 50%+ YoY growth
- Engineering team of 5+ developers
- Cloud-native architecture (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Recent performance/scaling issues
- VC-backed or strong revenue growth

VALUE PROPOSITIONS:
1. ENGINEERING VELOCITY
   - 60% reduction in operational overhead
   - Automated deployment and scaling
   - Real-time performance insights

2. RELIABILITY & SCALE
   - 99.9% uptime guarantee
   - Auto-scaling for traffic spikes
   - Proactive issue detection

3. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE
   - Intuitive dashboards and alerts
   - API-first integration approach
   - Minimal learning curve

COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS:
- Purpose-built for fast-growing SaaS
- Developer-friendly setup (5 min integration)
- Predictive scaling algorithms
- Cost optimization recommendations

OBJECTION HANDLING:

"We're building this internally"
→ "Building monitoring infrastructure can take 6+ months of engineering time. What if you could ship 2-3 major features instead while we handle the operational complexity?"

"We're not ready to scale yet"
→ "The best time to implement monitoring is before you need it. When you hit a scaling wall, it's already too late. Our early-stage pricing makes it cost-effective to start now."

"We use open source tools"
→ "Open source is great for getting started, but maintaining and scaling those tools becomes a full-time job. Our platform gives you enterprise-grade reliability without the operational overhead."

TECHNICAL OBJECTIONS:

"Security concerns"
→ "We're SOC2 Type II certified with enterprise-grade security. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, with role-based access controls."

"Vendor lock-in fears"
→ "All your data is exportable, and we provide full API access. Many customers actually reduce vendor dependencies by consolidating multiple monitoring tools."

NEXT STEPS:
1. Technical demo with engineering team
2. Free trial setup (14-day)
3. Scaling assessment and roadmap
4. Reference customer introduction
5. Pilot project with success metrics

PRICING STRATEGY:
- Start with usage-based pricing
- Emphasize cost per value (cost per user monitored)
- Show total cost of ownership vs alternatives
- Offer pilot pricing for first 90 days

SUCCESS METRICS:
- 75% trial-to-paid conversion rate
- Average deal size: $85K ARR
- 90% customer retention rate
- 4.7/5 Net Promoter Score
